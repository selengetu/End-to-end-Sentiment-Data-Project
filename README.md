## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have a GitHub account to clone and interact with this repository.

This repository contains a data engineering project developed using Apache Spark on Databricks, structured around the medallion architecture (bronze, silver, gold stages). It demonstrates a real-time data streaming and sentiment analysis pipeline for Twitter data, enhanced with MLflow for model tracking and management. The project leverages advanced data transformation techniques and real-time analytics, showcasing best practices in handling large-scale data streams and model lifecycle management in a distributed computing environment.
